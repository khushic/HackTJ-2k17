 		<figcaption><a href="http://www.palantir.com"> We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it.
With good data and the right technology, people and institutions today can still solve hard problems and change the world for the better.
In 2004, when we looked at the available technology, we saw products that were too rigid to handle novel problems, and custom systems that took too long to deploy and required too many services to maintain and improve.
We saw automated approaches that failed against adaptive adversaries, and all or nothing access controls that forced organizations to make unacceptable trade offs between collaborating and securing sensitive data from misuse.
We saw a need for a different kind of technology, and we knew it would take a different kind of company to build it. That is why we founded Palantir.</a></figcaption>

At the Internet advertising company DoubleClick (now owned by Google), the team developed and used many custom data stores to work around the shortcomings of existing databases. The business served 400,000 ads per second, but often struggled with both scalability and agility. Frustrated, the team was inspired to create a database that tackled the challenges it faced at DoubleClick.</a></figcaption>
