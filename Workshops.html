 		Big Parser
 		</h5>
 		<h4>
 		Big Parser gave hackers an overview of Big Parser, including a fun example where they searched up Korean movies about dogs! We learned the benefits of Big Parser compared to other common spreadsheets, like Excel and Google Sheets. We were also taught how to use Big Parsers API and use Data Wrangler to integrate data.

		Break Into Tech
 		</h5>
 		<h4>
Alice Shi from MakeSchool explained the details of internships and computer science programs after high school. The workshop was specifically targeted towards seniors, but many underclassmen attended and gained valuable insight. For example, we learned that there were specific programs that were targeted towards rising college freshmen, and the differences between internships at large companies versus startups.
